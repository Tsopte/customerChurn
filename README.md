All of these can be tackled successfully through the application of Data Science and through it, Machine Learning, to exploit the data and give both the customer and the retailer what they require for the growth of their business.

We will be using , in synergy Python along with its machine learning libraries such as scikit learn , pandas and numpy for data manipulation , matplotlib and seaborn for visualization  and the Django Framework  for Deployment.
